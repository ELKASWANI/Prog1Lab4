1. Write a program that receives a word as an input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome: if it reads the same backward as forward. A few examples are “civic”, “radar” and “level”. To make your program more advanced, ignore punctuation, capitalization, and spaces, and recognize sentences as “A man, a plan, a canal - Panama”, “Murder for a jar of red rum” and “Madam, I’m Adam”. 2. Write a program to validate email addresses. Use a loop to go over each character, and find an @ sign, followed by two or more words separated by dots. Examples of valid emails are araujot@vanier.college and araujot@vaniercollege.qc.ca, and invalid ones would be araujot&amp;vanier.college or araujot@vanier. 3. Write a program that generates a random number between 0 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. The user can have at maximum 10 trials. If the number is guessed, the user should be asked if she/he wants to play again. If the number is not guessed and 10 trials were used, the user is not lucky, the program should terminate with a proper message.
